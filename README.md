# AdvancedAnnealingSamplers
A survey of advanced annealing samplers for distributions that are difficult to sample from conventionally and benchmarks of these samplers against the performance of parallel chains of NUTS (No-U-Turn Sampler). Work completed as the final research project for Bayesian Modeling and Inference (6.7830).
